Scenario,Observed effect,AUROC drop (Δ),Interpretation
Low confidence predictions,High variance for both TP and FP,-0.06,Matching ambiguity dominates
Extreme aspect ratios,Variance decouples from error,-0.12,Geometric distortion dominates
Extreme small objects,Unstable early decoding,-0.13,Quantization + low signal-to-noise
Boundary IoU matches,Variance saturates,-0.18,Ambiguity becomes mostly aleatoric
