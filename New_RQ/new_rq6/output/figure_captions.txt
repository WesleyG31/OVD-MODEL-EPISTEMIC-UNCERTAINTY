Figure RQ6.1. Inter-layer bounding-box variance across decoder depth for true positives 
and false positives. Separation increases at later layers, indicating that decoder dynamics 
progressively concentrate epistemic signal on error-prone detections.

Figure RQ6.2. AUROC of uncertainty-based error detection as a function of decoder layer. 
Late layers yield higher AUROC, supporting the hypothesis that epistemic alignment emerges 
after semantic stabilization.
