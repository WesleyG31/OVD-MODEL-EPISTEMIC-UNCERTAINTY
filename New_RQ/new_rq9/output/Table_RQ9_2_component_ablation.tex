\toprule
Component removed & ΔECE & ΔAURC & ΔRisk@80% cov & Conclusion \\
\midrule
Temperature scaling & +0.015 & +0.004 & +0.01 & Class calibration helps but is insufficient \\
IoU mapping & +0.013 & +0.018 & +0.09 & Geometric reliability is shift-sensitive \\
Late-layer variance & +0.006 & +0.021 & +0.11 & Ranking depends on epistemic signal \\
Fusion & +0.010 & +0.012 & +0.07 & Complementarity improves robustness \\
