FIGURE CAPTIONS - RQ9
=====================

Figure RQ9.1. Metric degradation with increasing shift severity. 
Calibration error grows faster than ranking risk (AURC), indicating that 
post-hoc calibration is more fragile than uncertainty ordering.

Figure RQ9.2. Accuracy collapse (mAP) under increasing shift severity. 
The strong decline motivates reliability-aware rejection rather than reliance 
on raw confidence alone.


TABLE CAPTIONS - RQ9
====================

Table RQ9.1. Performance and reliability under controlled shift. 
Calibration degrades sharply even when ranking remains partially preserved.

Table RQ9.2. Component ablation under shift. Localization calibration tends 
to fail earlier than uncertainty ranking.
